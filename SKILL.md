# Podcast Transcript (spoken.md)

Search for podcast episodes and fetch transcripts as clean markdown with speaker names and timestamps.

## Steps

1. Find the episode:
   - If the user provided a numeric episode ID, skip to step 2
   - If the user provided a URL (Spotify, YouTube, etc.) or a text description, search for it:
     - `GET https://spoken.md/search?q={query or URL}`
     - Include header `x-api-key: {SPOKEN_API_KEY}` (use `pt_demo` if no key is set — returns demo episode only)
     - Show the user the results and let them pick, or pick the best match if unambiguous
   - If unclear what episode they want, ask

2. Fetch the transcript using the WebFetch tool:
   - URL: `https://spoken.md/transcripts/{id}`
   - Include header `x-api-key: {SPOKEN_API_KEY}` (use `pt_demo` if no key is set — demo episode only)

3. Handle the response:
   - **200**: Return the markdown transcript to the user
   - **401**: Tell the user they need an API key. They can get one at https://spoken.md ($10 for 100 episodes)
   - **402**: Tell the user their credits are depleted. The response includes a `top_up_url` — they need to POST to it to buy more credits
   - **404**: Tell the user no transcript was found for that episode
   - **502**: Upstream error — suggest retrying in a moment

4. If the response includes `X-Credits-Remaining` header, mention how many credits remain. Note: `X-Credits-Charged: 0` means this episode was already fetched before (repeat fetches are free).
